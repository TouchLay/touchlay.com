##What is the nova?

The nova is our newest hardware innovation: It is a 55” monitor, which can turn 360° on the horizontal axis and can be mounted in upright or in landscape format on the vertical axis.

The nova is highly flexible and can be used in different fields of work. We recommend nova especially for usage in the building industry, construction trades, show rooms, exhibitions, fairs, the advertising industry, digital signage, info points, as well as the entertainment and gaming industry. Special software solutions are currently being developed for each field of application.
